Hi, I’m ThankGod Emmanuel, the Founder and CEO of Drauig, a software company based in Nigeria.

I’m interested in software development, artificial intelligence, and building innovative tech solutions that can make a difference.

I’m currently working on a programming language called Sora and exploring new technologies in web and software development.

I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those related to programming languages, AI, and data analytics.

You can connect with me on LinkedIn or through my email at thankgodofem219@gmail.com.
